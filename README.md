# CoreMath
Personal implementations of some core linear math concepts in C++.

Focuses are on:
- Accuracy: comes coupled with a unit testing framework.
- Precision: 32 and 64 bit support on all core types.
- Portability: no intrinsics, written in the most up-to-date C++ (that I can muster).
- Utility: spacial partitioning, random number generation, other related concepts that I need.

Less focused on:
- Speed
- Compile time
- Library size
